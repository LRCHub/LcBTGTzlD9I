Baby let me be
Your lovin' Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be (oh let him be)
Your teddy bear

I don't wanna be a tiger
Cause tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind You
Love enough
I just wanna be
Your Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be (oh let him be)
Your Teddy Bear

Oh baby let me be
Around you every night
Run your fingers through my hair
And cuddle me real tight
Oh let me be (oh let him be)
Your Teddy Bear
I don't wanna be a tiger
Cause tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
Cause lions aren't the kindYou
Love enou-ou-ou-ough
Just wanna be your Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be (oh let him be)
Your teddy bear
Oh let me be (oh let him be)
(Your teddy bear)
I just wannaBe your Teddy Bear (ooh)
